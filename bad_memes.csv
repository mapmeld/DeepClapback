No,Hot damn. Also what if DC and Marvel released graphic novels with this level of detail in them every year  or six months for their characters rather than a short book a month? I feel like we might get much better stories. We'd lose a lot of story opportunities for inter-connectivity for sure but if they really took their time and perfected things we might have better stories that sold better too. Books would be a bigger deal rather than background noise. But I don't have any sales data in front of me so I could be wrong.

lol,"Now that I've thought on this all night - AMD has absolutely nailed it.  At this point benchmarks don't matter, they have the thunder.  I'm going to buy this thing before I see any reviews, and I don't care.  Here's why.  They have effectively shifted the conversation to *value*.  $199 is a price point that makes this thing affordable to a huge majority of people.  For some benchmarks won't matter because they can't afford anything else.  I've been in that camp, that's what made me go team red WAAAYYY back in the day with the ""Thunderbird"" Athlon.    For others, like me, $200 is in the range of ""fun money"".  I can afford $200 on a whim and it won't affect my budget.  $400?  Sure I can afford it but it would potentially affect stuff like movies with the kids, golf balls (my son loves golf, we're terrible, go through lots of golf balls), car parts, and my other fun stuff.   So with these two in mind, even if this thing is 60% the performance of 1070, it's an incredible value.  And if it's not fast enough?  Add another for CF which with the low power requirements is attainable for the masses, or sell it when Vega hits.    Now it's entirely possible that the benchmarks will suck and this is all hype train, but the R9 series were champs.  I'm buying one of these on launch."

Lol,"Someone is stupid just because they don't have a large vocabulary? I know plenty of people who you would think are ""stupid"" but I would trust them with my life, they don't have a large vocabulary, but they werent raised with that being a priority, it's not that they are stupid, it's that they haven't had a need for that knowledge. Regardless of that, do you honestly think Trump is stupid? The man is a billionaire, winning the Republican nomination with the most votes in the history of the party, has raised millions of dollars for veterans while doing so and is potentially on his way to a presidency. Just because someone doesnt have the same skill set you do. Or a skill set you value. Doesn't mean they are stupid. How about get informed, understand some people didn't grow up in the same place, you did, they don't have the same values you do, and that's ok, they arent stupid for it. You're an ass for thinking that. How about watch some of Trump's rallies, watch all of the rallies candidates rallies, see the emotions on the face of the people backing him. He might have different ideals than you do, and it's ok for you not to agree with him. But the man is not an idiot."

It could be seen as a sort of response to Richtofen being swallowed by the Thrasher earlier, which prompts Dempsey to pull out the skull. He even nodded at Nikolai.

"","This is part of a trend that's been going back quite a while.  I remember way back during the GWB days, he got accused of similar things and not taking questions, and controlling the message.  Of course, it was terrible said all the Dems.  Now Clinton is going half a year without a press conference.  We all know she tries to control questions and press.  Remember the ""muscular"" newspaper articles she made people write?  It's sickening but really the sickening thing is the media actually does it."
k,"Actually, it's not that simple, although this popular opinion has certainly permeated a lot of the research. Kluge (25. edition) states that the problem with saying that NE ""checkmate"" as well as NHG ""schachmatt"" come from the Persian expression is the way of the borrowing and the coinciding sound development, which is unclear. More recent research believes that a Germanic word was an additional or even the primary influence (!) of the term. The origin of the younger European term was apparently Old French ""esch(i)ec"" ‚Äòbounty, prize‚Äô (the king in the game being the bounty, so the word became the name of the game itself). This word (according to Kluge and Pfeifer) is borrowed from a Germanic language (probably ONFRK *skƒÅk-), see OHG ""scƒÅh"" m. ‚Äòrobbery‚Äô, MHG ""schƒÅch"", OFR ""skƒÅk"", MLG ""schƒÅk"", MNL ""scaec"" (germ. *skƒìka- m.).  All that aside, I think the expression ""game over"" works quite well to substitute ""checkmate""."

lol,"I think that the ideal standard for women (being slim/toned) is easier to achieve than being jacked as fuck.  Being slim just means making sure you don't eat too much, and doing some exercise, maybe some running and some weights a couple-few times per week.

For a better entry level VN, I'd suggest Fruit of Grisaia (also has a fanpatch with the adult content you can try out).  Grisaia makes sure to let everyone keep interacting with each other even after selecting a route, and I never felt bored.  Excellent translation overall and a pretty excellent intro VN with a great blend of comedy and drama. Also really like the MC. He's a pretty cool, funny guy.  If you want to check if you like the characters, watch the first 1 or 2 episodes of The Fruit of Grisaia (note the VN doesn't have the odd emphasis on panty shots that 8bit's adaptation has).

k,"Surprisingly the Cavs 1-on-1 defense was fine in this game, Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson fared perfectly fine on switches. Where the absolutely massive defensive errors came were in the aspect of communication (the lack thereof or confusion) concerning defensive scheme. This was especially in regards to off ball and transition defense. Pick and roll defense was passable and helped them contain the GSW back court, however off-ball, the Cavs overreacted too much to their threat. Curry cutting back door ? His man and the guy in the paint switch on to him leaving Draymond/Barnes open. This happened time after time all game. The Cavs also resorted to stand around iso ball as opposed to moving the ball around, the lack of off ball cuts made me go insane. It‚Äôs Golden State‚Äôs off ball movement that constantly gets them good shots, opponent defenders have a hard time keeping man and ball in front of them so will always be a step behind. Seamless switching like OKC did is extremely rare and is something that after watching this game the Cavs are not capable of. I understand Lue going to Love early in 2Q to make as much use of Curry being out of the game but it threw their entire rotation out of whack and they didn't get Frye into the game or play that bench lineup that was so great. Lebron was incredibly passive in the 2nd half kicking out of nearly every drive or passing it to Kyrie and then standing and letting him iso. He needs to be moving much more on offense to put pressure on the Warriors defense. After letting the warriors bench get hot in the first half they smoked the Cavs to start the 4Q and blew the game open. Predictably Curry and Klay hit threes later in 4Q to stave off any comback. Cleveland either has to be much better offensively or defensively because besides the work they put in on Curry and Klay, their defense was utter trash and the offense wasn‚Äôt much better. If they don‚Äôt make adjustments, they are losing this quite handily. While they stayed close through 3Q that kind of performance will lead to a 15 pt lead for the Warriors next time.  Also a note on refs, they hardly called anything this game for both sides. I think they tried to be as fair as possible, it was just that Cavs were forced to take more contested shots inside (whereas most Warriors shots inside weren‚Äôt contested as much if at all) so it felt like the weren‚Äôt giving them the benefit of the doubt.

Imagine if you posited to a professional anthropologist 50 years ago the idea of a culture wherein laypeople obsessively document their day to day lives. They would think that was the coolest thing ever.  History is the story of everyone, documenting our lives is an essential part of preserving our own stories. Why do people write memoirs and autobiographies? Why take photographs ever at all? It's because we know that we care about how people in the past lived and we assume people in the future will care about how we lived."

No,"Not having visible healthbars is so fucking far away from being something that promotes voice chat. 6 people constantly saying their health or if they're low or why they need health packs and such is clunky as fuck. Information should be easily available and easily readable. Health bars do not get in the way and if they want they can make it an option you opt-in to like friendly healthbars on S:76 and Zarya. Removing info that should be there and saying ""Well this should make you want to communicate"" is some fucking stone age thinking"
Nah ,It's a serious question bc I tagged it as such.
Lol,"Western governments, led by America, have been systematically unwinding social policy in favor of corporations since the 1980's. It began in earnest with Thatcher and Reagan, and in New Zealand with the Lange Labour government of the time (irony of ironies). By embracing neoliberalism the great lie of the time was that an unfettered market was self correcting (Adam Smiths invisible hand) and that government assistance to corporations would find it's way to ordinary folk through the ""trickle down"" effect. Well, we discovered that the hand is so invisible as to be non existent, and the trickle down up and trickled off. Now there is a whole new generation who knows no other way than user pays, slave pay, student loans and rampant homelessness. And a government so mired in this morally and economically bankrupt idea that they are blind to the realities that face their citizens.   In the face of such circumstances, when is it appropriate for a people to take matters into their own hands and restore the equilibrium that every functioning society needs? There is some measure of comfort that the governed far outnumber their governors, and that they can and do occasionally stand together to bring their masters to heal. Whether New Zealand is at that point yet is debatable. If we were united in our opposition to these events then, yes, you would have people occupying these properties and they would be supported by multiples more ready to fill the gap created by their arrests. Unfortunately, I suspect that most people who read these forums are of the generation who know no other way. It's a great and timely topic of discussion OP. I fear it will simply be downvoted to oblivion."

Even with a Democrat Congress there is a good chance he doesn't get his policies passed. Look at Obama trying to pass the ACA for example. Under Clinton MAYBE we could get some expansion or improvement of ObamaCare, even that doesn't seem likely though. What kind of taste would that leave in the American publics mouth if the most progressive candidate ever elected got nothing done in 8 years? Don't say they would point out Republican obstructionism because the public doesn't even do that now with Obama as president. I prefer Sanders health care plan, but there is no hope of something like that passing in the next 8 years."

There are two sexes, and that is an absolute binary (exception: hermaphrodite, but that is such a statistically rare natural occurrence that the point is moot). However, gender is more of a gradient that exists between masculinity and femininity. Ultimately, that gradient still settles at two absolute endpoints, masculine and feminine, but one may still identify somewhere in the middle.   I guess the tl;dr is that there are probably actually about 3 genders. Mostly masculine, mostly feminine, or equally both. I think getting more nuanced then that with exact percentages of masculine traits vs. feminine traits is just semantics and splitting hairs."

There are people in all communities whose dating ""tastes"" are more informed by racism than by actual aesthetic preferences.

Decades from now, I'd like for DGD to be held in the highest regard for their contributions to post-hardcore from 2005-onward. Particularly, I want Jonny, Kurt, and Tilian to get the respect they each deserve as vocalists and artists.  I'd like to believe that DGD might have a more intellectually driven and creatively gifted fanbase than most bands using the screamer/singer combination. Sure, it's great to have fun and it's healthy to not take things too seriously, but maintaining the integrity and legacy of the band is very important to me (might even be more important to me and other fans than it is to the band themselves)."

YES!,"Here's what I posted the past time this question was asked:  * Casting a white person in a non white role is not the same as casting a person of color in a role that's traditionally white.   * The biggest reason that the Ghostbusters remake gets as much hate as it does is sexism, and Melissa McCarthy and Leslie Jones are way funnier than a lot of dudes on this sub give them credit for.   * Space Jam is not a good movie. Like....at all. It's a basketball shoe commerical that got stretched out to 88 minutes including opening and closing credits. And it's a huge disservice to the Looney Tunes characters, who deserve **WAY** better treatment than they've gotten.   * Dredd is overrated on this sub. Judge Dredd isn't a terribly interesting character to begin with.   * Superhero movies in general are fun entertainments, but people take them way too seriously. I've enjoyed all the Marvel movies up to this point, but I'm not under the impression that any of them are more than a clever, corporate blockbuster. The more ""seriously"" a superhero movie takes itself, the less likely I am to enjoy it. Superheroes are inherently silly.  * People who create posts about how to ""fix"" movies are wasting their time. Back seat directors are a real pet peeve of mine.   * Anyone who thinks that A.I. should have ended with David at the bottom of the ocean talking to the Blue Fairy for all eternity is wrong. Also, anyone who thinks A.I. would have been better with Kubrick directing is wrong. A.I.'s ending is perfect.   * The whole push for ""R"" ratings as a sign of quality is garbage. I'm tired of ""badasses.""   * I suppose this goes hand in hand with the Space Jam comment, but a lot of things that people are nostalgic for are pretty much garbage. Space Jam, Power Rangers, Full House, etc. At least The Force Awakens and Jurassic World are tapping into nostalgia for something good.   Updated:   * Fans are probably the worst part of any franchise. Their expectations and vocal outrage when elements of their favorite properties are changed hinder the creative process.   * Fuck Chris Stuckman in general. I know he's a popular critic among the internet crowd, but that dude is a terrible critic. (His recent partnering with a ""for-profit"" education college only confirms my initial opinion of him. "

Being a paying customer does not allow you to dictate what content the content creator deems suitable for release. It certainly isn't something worth being called a ""slap in the face.""  The two comments he makes reference to are firstly incorrect, inaccurate and themselves massive overreactions.  &gt; What I don't agree with however is that he does so without an explanation, apology, or anything else towards his paying customers.

Anyway, we had a police day where the police visited and had a few talks, showed us some gear and so on. One of the talks was a bout shoplifting. I don't remember exactly what the officer said, but it was something along the lines that if you stole from a shop you would be caught. Guaranteed. They had fingerprints, cameras and computer systems that counted every item in the store that would notify the police and the management immediately when an item went missing.  I found this extremely hard to believe. So right after school I had to test it. I went to the grocery store and stole a small candy bar.  15 years later I am still at large. Me 1, Police 0."

How about that:  Ppy/EE had problems with w33's attitude, so they were looking to replace him after the major. rtz finally agrees to join, if universe comes with him. That s why misery also had to go. On paper this a good deal anyway, since universe was undoubtedly one of the best offlaners at the time and rtz is a great player.  But Misery was more than just offlaner. He was also the social backbone of secret. The guy that was able to make people talk to each other or mitigate arguments. I know, a lot of people say ""waaaah, are professionals, social stuff is for pussys"", but that s not true. You can say what you want, a team is a social construct and if teammats cant cope with each other it s doomed to fail.  And then misery was gone. Neither puppey nor ee saw the problems that would arise. That they wouldn t be able to forge a new team out of this raw talent.  And this might actually the story of how ppy and ee teams fail and have failed in the past. Secret 2.0 was only able to run on a placebo (ppy said it in an interview, I m to lazy to look for it now), in the character portrait for notail at last ti you could see how cloud9 was falling apart due to not being able to merge on a human level.  So this is their doom, ppy's and ee's. Creating at least somehow succesfull teams, but relying on other people to manage the social topics within the team. Once these are gone, the teams will fall apart.   And this is why this secret is bound to fail and we allready can look forward to how the next Secret will look like."

Fuck you,I've already voted Remain. I've not seen one plausible economic argument for leaving yet and the main leave arguments are about immigration which I am not against.   What's worrying is that I suspect the UK will vote leave mainly due to the number of older voters who read newspapers like the Daily Mail and get fired up on hoax stories about how the EU want all bananas to be straight. A vote of leave will undeniably put the stock markets into a tailspin and leave the UK in a weaker bargaining position in the world market than it would be as part of the EU. And those older voters will have left a right mess for the younger generations to deal with.

K ,"&gt; Scarlet Embers has always been a server attempting to make things fair for everyone.   Sounds like socialism. Your economy is illegitimate, and you banned Aeskdar/Hythe for being capitalist and bringing competition. Also, while Hythe's industrial power on 24CC may be frustratingly unmatchable, there are a few things that make up for it. 1, I have never seen them undercut, and in fact, I undercut them all the time. 2, they aren't abusive staff. If I sold stuff for cheaper than they do (which I do), they wouldn't fucking ban me. 3, the freedom to match Hythe. If I was crazy enough, I could make farms as big as theirs and use alts as much as they do to match them. I could use the most brutal economic tactics possible short of griefing them and they wouldn't ban me. Everyone on 24CC has the 'unfair advantages' you speak of. The freedom to do what I want without childish and invasive staff monitoring and judging my every move and banning based on opinion is what makes 24CC the superior server.   It seems to me like you guys just couldn't handle how much better they were than you at economics and industry. Glad to be playing on the server where the mature guys are in charge."

Lol,"http://rense.com/general37/fascism.htm &gt;Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.  Trumps complete disdain for anything other than american. His entire campaign is run on American exceptional-ism.  &gt;Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ""need."" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.  ""We should torture even if it doesn't work"" and ""we should kill the families of terrorist"". Brilliant quotes of Donald Trump with great regard for human rights.  &gt;Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.  Muslims, mexicans, blacks, minorites......anyone non white  &gt;Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.  Largest most powerful military in the world just keeps needing more and more money.  &gt;Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.  ""Blood coming out of her whatever"" Donald Trump  &gt;Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.  Unfortunately for Trump and his gang he doesn't have this ticked yet. I'm sure he will though cause he's promised to go after media for nonsense...First amendment not important at all.  &gt;Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.  ""Ban all Muslims from america"" Donald trump. Constant bickering from his gang that isis is taking over american when it is factually true than isis is in syria....half way around the globe....and is at the moment loosing ground.  &gt;Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.  Fortunately for Trump i doubt he's ever even read a word of the bible. Right has shown that given the chance they'ed cross out the first amendment again and enforce Christianity on america.  &gt;Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.  Fortunately for trump his rhetoric doesn't fit this narrative. Unfortunately for him he is the embodiment of corporate corrupting power over the american middle class.  &gt;Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.  Labor power = communism in his supporters minds. Clear lack of understanding of the influence of labor and unions in protecting the american middle class.  &gt;Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.  Dismissal of climate change in the face of all the evidence.  &gt;Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.  Absolute love of police. Dismissal of police abuse against African American.  &gt;Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.  Fortunately for trump he's never held power to fulfill this mark  &gt;Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.  Fortunately for trump he's never held office to tick of this mark.   10/14-&gt;71%....i'd say that's a pass."

The consequences were imminently foreseeable. This complete lack of empathy is all too common in women when they truly don't care about something despite knowing that you do. I get the sense that this is very common in your marriage - that she lacks much real empathy for your feelings and only cares about herself. I could be wrong.   I think you should be able to judge the most based on her reaction when it happened. Did she immediately inform you and start looking? Sounds to me like she interrupted your trip so YOU could come back and search - aka rectify her wrong. What does she say you should do now? Get a new dog or hell no? Consider those questions OP. I'm sure you have, I bet that's why you are slowly realizing she really is not bothered at all by losing the dog. And she isn't bothered by the fact that you're bothered by it - except to the extent that your anger inconveniences her.   Good luck, OP. Stay strong."

Nope.,"There's nothing random about the capitalization, he did that correctly for the title of something.   He should've put the name of the game in quotation marks, but there's nothing random about anything there.   You could always just, y'know, follow the link and answer that question pretty quickly for yourself rather than complaining about it. I can guarantee it took you longer to write out that comment than it would to click on the link and read the first few words that pop up on the screen.   Also, if we're going to be unnecessary grammar Nazis, you left out the word ""of"" in your sentence. It should've read: ""...because of your randomly capitalized letters.""  Your sentence also made no grammatical sense due to the lack of an actual subject at the beginning. It should've read as follows:  ""I can't tell what the name of the game is due to your random capitalization.""  Or:  ""I can't tell which part of your title states the name of the game because your random capitalization is confusing.""  That's how I would've done it. Either sentence works, and either one is more grammatically accurate than your original one. Of course, you can trade out ""random capitalization"" for ""randomly capitalized letters"", as you put it, but my revision is more concise since there's no need to define what is being capitalized- it's going to be letters in this context.

lol,keep slayin boi
Why not?,That shouldn't be being used in this test.
.,Great mini doc. HORRIBLE title. Who the fuck thought that was a good idea?
Lol,"In the past, there was design as you are claiming. In our modern industrial manufacturing facilities, there still lies the whole field of optimization of the equipment. Simulation software has been around for decades now; refineries used to use Pro II for design of equipment back in the 1980s. So I disagree.   We are just in a downswing currently of job growth. But job growth doesn't necessarily mean that more jobs won't become available. The demand for chemical engineers has somewhat plateaued, but as baby boomers begin retiring over the next decade, more positions will begin to open up and we will see an influx of younger engineers replacing the senior engineers.   "
No,"Please avoid generalizing when speaking of African countries. The sub region of Southern Africa is more tolerant of homosexuality than others. With some states recognizing same sex unions. In my small country slurs is probably the most you'll get. Im unaware of a hate motivated homocide.against a gay person. In fact we had a media circus in the last decade when a lesbian allegedly murdered her partner. If you're referring to the persecution of gays going on in Uganda and North African states please make a mention of it. Kenya being a neighbour of Uganda also has a poor track record with regards to homosexual freedoms.  In conclusion: In Southern Africa you are quite unlikely to be killed for being gay. More likely to be killed - as many are - for your material possessions. So it would be polite if you refrained from using ""Africa"" as a buzzword."
Exactly ,Bobby Orr or Super Mario?
Lol,Toyota hilux
Yes.,"Haven't seen him play since he left DC, how's he been at Hearts?"

Whoosh,"Umm... yes. Is that a problem? I knew girls who were having sex at 13, 14, and 15 so it's not as if it's like they are never as sexually curious.  Or is pedophilia only ok if it's with a boy and he's asking for it?"
#,I would check out cortex hair studio in the highlands. That's where I go. Then again I don't have long hair. But it's worth checking out.
Nope. ,"Good for you, that doesn't make you right though. No he hasn't but he's a good player and is a better midfielder than Rooney."
Wat,"That's not how it happens. When you suffer massive head injury with a helmet typically your brain suffers rotational force that shears major portions of the ""wires"" (axons) connecting the neurons. You may also have significant disruption to vessels just because the brain is soft, and can move within the skull, putting stress on vessels at various points within the brain. This leads to intracranial bleeding and pressure issues that can overwhelm your bodies ability to supply blood to the brain (the pressure in the capillaries of the brain is less than the pressure within the skull, leading to wide spread ischemia and rapidly brain death). So you typically end up with either significant brain damage from the diffuse axonal shearing, which some can recover from to varying degrees (from functional recoveries to permanant vegetate states depending on the severity of damage), or with herniation of the soft brain through the skull and brain death from pressure and areas of ischemia dying and swelling that leads to global brain death.  The brain death from herniation and ischemia is not as fast as the ""head crushed like a watermelon"" example, but it is also no perceived by the patient because they have lost the ability to perceive and interpret pain far before these processes being to evolve. Typically, by the time you lose your last brain-stem functions, the part of your brain that makes you you is totally functionless, and likely non-vital (dead).    **BUT**, with this sort of death you end up being able to donate your organs, which is a beautiful gift to others in need as your parting contribution to the world-- saving directly several other lives and having your organs persist in life with purpose. I have no greater respect than for those who donate their organs after neurologic death (or the families that agree to donate organs after an unexpected brain death event), it is an absolute testament to their selflessness and dedication to fellow humans even during shockingly traumatic and awful times. You become a hero by donating organs, and your life's purpose is magnified directly as a result.   Source: Neurosurgery Resident Physician"
Ok,"Max out all allies Ki for 1 turn, but the effect wears off a little after the 1st anniversary celebration‚Ä¶"
YES,ARE CAPS REALLY NECESSARY?
lol,Spark has been nerfed like every patch since 2013.. WHY GGG
Thanks,Not sure why you got so many downvotes!  Nothing wrong with a little self promotion.  Keep vlogging and honing your craft and defining your style.
Wat,"A bit of a tangent, but I never really got why this was supposed to be a bad thing. *""I like this culture enough that I'm going to incorporate some aspects of it into my life!""*  Yeah, that's awful.  How horrible. "
Yes.,I currently play uncapped frames... does this mean I should cap them at 999?
Nah ,Salt? Is that you?

lol,Good point
Yes.,There's a case for the 2142 Northern Strike expansion pack too

Lol,"Technically! I'm just ribbin ya tho, I stopped enforcing the victory screen thing ages ago."
Yes. ,"Basically, he's a non-libertarian shit-bag we are using for publicity?   EDIT:  Thanks for the informative feed-back btw."
Nope,"""Man"" is a term of endearment man."
Oh,OH
nah ,"Dude, that works if you smurf in the 2k pool, in a proper game of your level a Disruptor with a bloodthorn first or a Antimage with blink dagger is either a) swimming in gold b) drunk or c) someone ruining your game"
Yep.,We'll see soon.
Lol,dude i'm right behind you
oh,"**SHUT UP! ALL I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT HISTORY IS WHAT SALON, THEGUARDIAN &amp; THE HUFFINGONPOST TELLS ME &amp; NOTHING ELSE!** "
No,"Playing devils advocate so we can see from a different perspective..  So if this is a sizable population near the pool and wishes to use it - then are the accommodations not an example of good governance? As in, hey we needed something specific to our community and we appealed to our government to do something, and they came to a compromise that *kinda* works for everyone.   Isnt this what democracy is about? "
Wrong ,your answer doesn't meet the single thing he asked for.
exactly,no spies = into the trash it goes
ok ,Hillary conceded when she got the sec of state deal locked. That was her Plan B for controlling foreign Clinton Foundation deals.

No. ,"Well there's also Mass Effect, Mirror's Edge, Dragon Age, Titanfall, etc. To say that they do nothing but mess up games is unfair... "
No,Curry is not a defensive liability. He is a good defender.
lol,"The Aryan Nation says that whites are superior to all races. La Raza, the NAACP, and other similar organizations do not say that their race is superior to other races. See the difference?"
:),Ok you're a special snowflake
what?,"&gt;I bet your real quick to point out visual flaws in games you don't love.   No, we're not that retarded.  Edit: He's editing his comments since he knows he's being downvoted. Check the timestamps. "
Yes,You'd rather have Doug Ford?
k,"Dude...every post of yours is some huge complaint or gripe about the game.  I also love how whenever someone disagrees with someone here it becomes a personal attack on them.  Lets not try to have a conversation about it, rather instead tell me I'm too dimwitted to see flaws.    Ive played this game since the original launch, so am well aware it is not perfect.  However, for a game pushing three years old, I think they are doing a pretty decent job keeping the game interesting.  Not sure about you, but I would very rarely play a game for more than a year.  This game has continually updated it in some way, shape, or form just about every single month, covering old gen to new gen and PC.  Good talk, pal. "
Who?,&gt;The Legend of WHO  Who?
Nope.,Civ v
K,"Ah, so you're saying we shouldn't have stopped the sponsoring of enslaving pirates? How was making an effort to protect our own citizens on the high seas an unjustified war? Also, pretty sure that nukes 40 miles from Florida in a hostile dictatorship shouldn't be ignored."
No,"Well now you do, so you can go."
No,You're going to find that many of the truths we cling to *depend* on our own point of view...
Woosh,"i dont know, i like explaining things in asides i guess."
fuck,"outcome may result to the fall of oil price again. because, every country will want to pump as much as possible, to retain their market and this may result to over supply which always leads to the fall of oil price. "
lol,"OK well done, you've baited me one last time.  I didn't say super-important.  I have a job looking after vulnerable people, so they're counting on me.  Not that you'd care, but then I never said you would.  And a white flag implies I'm surrendering, which implies I'm agreeing to your terms.  This is obviously not the case.  Call it retreating if you like, but not surrendering.  And I will have a great day, I very much enjoy it.  I'd thank you but it was clearly sarcasm.  I don't know what you do with your days but I honestly hope you have a good one too, maybe it'll make you less inclined to try to shit on people in future.  Again, retreating.  Goodnight.  :)"
F,"My Mom passed away just over 10 years ago when I was 15. The pain gets easier every year to the point where I rarely think about it. Now I'm crying, thanks Futurama.  *Edit: Thanks for the condolences, and right back at those with a similar loss. It was a good cry though!"
